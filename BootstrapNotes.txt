Bootstrap 5, no longer have to import jquery

the downside of using the CDN is that you cannot update any source files 

if you download the Source Files for bootstrap you can use SASS
-- SASS lets you edit the bootstrap variables. it is a precompiler

in html - emmett and drop the bootstrap CDN above the title for CSS
          drop bootstrap CDN above the closing body tag for JS & Popper

creating the navbar in bootstrap

*** remember HTML shorthand in VSCode:

  nav.navbar.navbar-expand-lg.bg-dark.navbar-dark 
= <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-dark navbar-dark"></nav>

in the nav-bar -- navbar-dark       = makes the text light (so it will show up)
                  navbar-expand-lg  = set it so the navbar will show on the screen until it is reduced by a certain amount.
                                        it could be set to sm (for small) and the screen would have to shrink smaller before the text stopped displaying
		  ms-auto           = margin start-auto -- in this project we pushed the #learn, #questions, & #instructors to the right in the navbar
